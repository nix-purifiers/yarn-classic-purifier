# Yarn's offline mirror for the downloads of lib-overlays/default/lock.nix: a tree of
# links, each at the file name Yarn looks the package up by.
#
# The shared purifier library fetches the entries. A file entry is a
# locked tarball. A git entry becomes the tarball Yarn's GitFetcher would have written to the
# mirror. For a repository without a `prepare` script, that is a tar of the
# commit's files at the archive root, as `git archive` writes it. For a
# repository with one, Yarn installs the repository with its
# devDependencies, which runs the `prepare` script, and packs the result;
# here the install runs offline against the mirror of the repository's own
# yarn.lock, which the git entry carries in `downloads`. Yarn reads a tar
# whose entries lie at the root as an unpacked package, so the packed
# package goes into the mirror with the `package/` directory of `yarn pack`
# removed.
#
# Yarn Classic clones a git dependency without its submodules, so the
# checkouts leave them out too.
