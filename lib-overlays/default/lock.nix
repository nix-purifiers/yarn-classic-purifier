#               `path`, the file's name in the mirror. A tarball is a file
#               entry { path, url, mirrors, hash }: `url` is the lock's
#               `resolved` without its `#` fragment, `mirrors` lists other
#               URLs that serve the same file, and `hash` is an SRI hash. A
#               git
#               dependency is a git entry
#               { path, git = { url, rev, submodules }, hash, prepare }
#               with `hash` the SRI hash of the checkout as nix-prefetch-git
#               reports it; one whose repository has a `prepare` script also
#               carries `downloads`, the mirror of the repository's own
#               yarn.lock, and `yarnLock`, the text of that yarn.lock, when
#               the repository has none and the lock command resolved one.
#               pkgs/build-yarn-classic-project/offline-mirror.nix turns each git entry into the
#               tarball Yarn reads from the mirror.

#               lockfile and has none, as { resolved, url } for a tarball

#
# yarn.lock records an SRI `integrity` for every registry tarball, and older
# lockfiles a SHA-1 in the `#` fragment of `resolved`. A tarball from
# another URL, such as a GitHub dependency that Yarn fetches from
# codeload.github.com, carries no hash in yarn.lock, and neither does a git
# dependency. The purifier lockfile (yarn-classic-purifier.lock.json,
# written by `yarn-classic-purifier lock`) records them, keyed by
# `resolved`. It holds its format `version`, the `inputsHash` of the
# yarn.lock it was written for, and the `contentHash` of its own content:
# the SHA-256 of its JSON without `contentHash`, with keys sorted and no
# whitespace, which is what builtins.toJSON prints.
