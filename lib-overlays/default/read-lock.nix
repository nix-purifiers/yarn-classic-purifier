#             and the purifier lockfile lock (lib-overlays/default/lock.nix). Yarn
#             Classic fetches every package on every system, so no entry
#             carries `systems`. A git entry for a repository with a
#             `prepare` script carries the entries of the repository's own
#             yarn.lock in `downloads`.

#   problems  why the lockfiles cannot be used, each naming the command
#             that fixes it

# The builder passes it to `checkLock` of the purifier library.
