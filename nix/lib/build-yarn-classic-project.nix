# buildYarnClassicProject: sandboxed builds of a Yarn Classic (Yarn 1)
# project, from the yarn.lock at its root. The project needs no Nix files of
# its own: yarn.lock names every tarball the install fetches, with its
# hash, and the package.json files name the project's own packages (the
# root and its workspaces).
#
# The file is a package for callPackage: the first argument set is what it
# takes by name from the scope `pkgs.yarn-classic-purifier`, which the
# flake's `overlays.default` adds to the package set, and the result is the
# builder. A package written for callPackage takes the scope by name:
#
#   { yarn-classic-purifier }:
#   (yarn-classic-purifier.buildYarnClassicProject { src = ./.; }).packages.my-app
#
# and `buildYarnClassicProject.override` replaces what the builder takes.
# The builder returns
#
#   packages.<name>   package <name> of the project, installed with its
#                     production dependencies under lib/node_modules, with
#                     its commands in bin/
#   tests             the project after `yarn install`, its build scripts
#                     and its test scripts, run in the sandbox
#   release           the project after `yarn install`, its build scripts
#                     and `yarn pack`: one tarball per package of the
#                     project, the files `yarn-classic-purifier publish`
#                     uploads
#   fetches           the `entries` of the lock in memory: the entries of
#                     the purifier library that the build fetches; a git
#                     entry for a repository with a `prepare` script carries
#                     the entries of the repository's yarn.lock in
