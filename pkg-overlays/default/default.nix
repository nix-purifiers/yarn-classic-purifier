# The default package overlay. It adds one attribute to the package set:
# the scope `pkgs.yarn-classic-purifier`, made with lib.makeScope. The scope
# holds the packages of pkgs/ (`.yarn`, the offline wrapper, and
# `.yarn-classic-purifier`, the command) and the builder
# `.buildYarnClassicProject` (pkgs/build-yarn-classic-project/default.nix), a
# package for callPackage in that scope. `.overrideScope` replaces what
# everything in the scope shares, `.buildYarnClassicProject.override`
# replaces what the builder takes, and a package written for callPackage
# takes the scope by name. A consumer that lists this flake in `projects`
# holds it as `yarn-classic-purifier/default`, which its package sets apply
# by default.
